# Dsci-100-Project
Group portion of the Data Science 100 Project.
Our question of interest is What combination of Age and Hours played on the minecraft server makes a player more likely to subscribe to a game-related newsletter? To do this we will build a classification model to predict if a player will be subscribed to a game-related newsletter based on the predictors Age and played_hours.
